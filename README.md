### üèÜ Recent Major Improvements

**‚úÖ Complete JavaScript Refactoring (Dec 2024)**

- Transformed monolithic 858-line `app.js` into 5 focused modules (584 total lines)
- **notifications.js** (36 lines): Toast notification system
- **modal-manager.js** (349 lines): All modal operations and state management
- **schedule-view.js** (154 lines): 24-hour grid visualization and calendar
- **app-core.js** (27 lines): Core utilities and HTMX coordination
- **app.js** (18 lines): Main application coordinator

**‚úÖ Critical Bug Fixes (Dec 2024)**

- Fixed infinite "Loading preview..." after first "Apply to Cron" use
- Resolved job vanishing issue (multiple pending jobs now supported)
- Fixed broken cancel button and missing detailed change previews
- Corrected schedule view display issues and day selector styling

**‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience**

- 24-hour schedule view (00:00-23:59) instead of limited 6 AM-11 PM window
- Descriptive action text: "Play Playlist", "Volume ‚Üí 45%", "Resume Playback"
- Color-coded job types with clear text labels for accessibility
- Improved modal state management and error handling

**‚úÖ 2025-07-07 - Robust Cron Diff, UI Sync, and Edit Reliability**

- **Cron Review Modal Diff**: Jobs are now matched by unique ID, so edits show as 'changed' (with field-by-field diffs), not as add/remove pairs. No more swap confusion or spurious changes.
- **UI State Sync**: After applying cron changes, the UI always re-fetches all jobs and updates all views, so you never see stale or invisible jobs.
- **Reliable Job Editing**: Editing a job always updates the correct job, even if you change speakers/zones in the modal. No more silent discards.
- **Zone Refresh Robustness**: The UI always refreshes the correct zone and job list after any add/edit/apply, with fallback to reload if needed.

**‚úÖ 2025-07-09 - Granular Zone & Service Control**

- **New `Connect` / `Disconnect` Actions**: Schedule speaker zone connections and disconnections independently of playback. You can now prepare a zone by setting its audio source (`Spotify` or `Apple Music`) and connecting speakers, then start playback later with a separate `play` job.
- **Service-Aware Actions**: All actions (`play`, `pause`, `resume`, `volume`) are now explicitly tied to either Spotify or Apple Music, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring the correct application is controlled.
- **Clarified UI**: The job creation modal now provides clear, contextual options and help text, distinguishing between playback commands and zone management.

**‚úÖ 2025-07-08 - Apple Music Support**

- You can now add Apple Music playlists, schedule Apple Music jobs, and control Apple Music playback, volume, and zones.
- Both Spotify and Apple Music jobs can be scheduled to different zones simultaneously.
- Apple Music jobs use AppleScript and require the Music app to be installed and accessible via osascript.
- UI and API support both services everywhere playlists or jobs are managed.

### üÜï 2025 Refactor: Service Modules & Bulletproof API

- All API endpoints are now thin wrappers; business logic is in `app/services/` modules:
  - `jobs_service.py`, `cron_service.py`, `speakers_service.py`, `playlists_service.py`
- API returns robust, conventional error codes:
  - `400` for bad input (missing/invalid fields, invalid time/days/action)
  - `404` for not found (update/delete non-existent job/playlist)
  - `409` for true conflicts (duplicate jobs/playlists)
- All file I/O is safe: `jobs.json` and `playlists.json` are always created if missing
- Test suite covers all edge cases, negative cases, and error codes
- No business logic remains in `api.py`‚Äîall validation, conflict, and file logic is in services

## üîí Cron Integration

### Sandboxed Block Format

AirCron uses isolated cron sections for safe management. The `aircron_run.sh` script is the entry point for all scheduled jobs, dispatching actions based on the provided arguments.

**Cron Job Structure:**
`MM HH * * D /path/to/aircron_run.sh 'SPEAKER_ZONE' 'ACTION' 'ARG1' 'ARG2' 'SERVICE'`

**Example `crontab` Block:**

```bash
# BEGIN AirCron (auto-generated; do not edit between markers)

# --- Office Zone ---

# Connect Office Zone to Apple Music at 8:55 AM on weekdays
55 8 * * 1-5 /path/to/aircron_run.sh 'Office Zone' 'connect' '' '' 'applemusic'

# Play "Focus" playlist in Office Zone at 9:00 AM on weekdays
0 9 * * 1-5 /path/to/aircron_run.sh 'Office Zone' 'play' 'Focus Playlist' '' 'applemusic'


# --- Kitchen Zone (Custom Group) ---

# Connect Kitchen and Living Room to Spotify at 6:00 PM on weekends
0 18 * * 6,7 /path/to/aircron_run.sh 'Custom:Kitchen,Living Room' 'connect' '' '' 'spotify'

# Play "Dinner Jazz" playlist in the custom zone at 6:05 PM on weekends
5 18 * * 6,7 /path/to/aircron_run.sh 'Custom:Kitchen,Living Room' 'play' 'spotify:playlist:...' '' 'spotify'

# END AirCron
```

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run test suite (now covers all edge cases and error codes)
pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=90
```

- All endpoints and error cases are tested: jobs, cron, speakers, playlists
- Edge cases: missing/invalid fields, invalid time/days/action, duplicate, not found, file creation
- API always returns correct HTTP status codes for all error types

### Development Server

```bash
python main.py
```

- Hot reload enabled in development
- Logs to console + file
- Browser auto-opens to `http://127.0.0.1:3009`

### Contributing

1. Follow PEP 8 style (enforced by `black` and `ruff`)
2. Add type hints for all functions
3. Update tests for new functionality
4. Use conventional commit messages
5. Ensure compatibility with macOS 10.13+

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "spotify-cli not found"

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install kylef/formulae/spotify-cli

# Or check PATH
which spotify
```

#### "No speakers found"

- Ensure Airfoil is running
- Check speaker connections in Airfoil GUI
- Click "Refresh" button in AirCron interface

#### "Cron jobs not executing"

```bash
# Check cron logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/AirCron/cron.log

# Verify crontab entries
crontab -l | grep -A 20 "BEGIN AirCron"
```

#### "Port 3009 already in use"

The application automatically kills existing processes on port 3009 during startup.

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting environment variable:

```bash
export AIRCRON_DEBUG=1
python main.py
```

### If you see 'Unknown' jobs in the review modal, it means there are orphaned cron lines not mapped to any job in jobs.json. These will be cleaned up on apply.

### If the UI ever seems out of sync, simply apply changes or reload‚Äîthe system will always re-sync jobs.json and the crontab.
