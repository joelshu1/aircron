1. **notifications.js** (36 lines)

   - Toast notification system
   - Success/error/info message display
   - Auto-dismiss and styling management

2. **modal-manager.js** (349 lines)

   - All modal operations (job creation, editing, cron review)
   - Modal state management and cleanup
   - Form submission and validation
   - HTMX integration for modal content

3. **schedule-view.js** (154 lines)

   - 24-hour schedule grid visualization
   - Day selector management
   - Job display with color coding and tooltips
   - Inline edit/delete operations

4. **app-core.js** (27 lines)

   - Core utilities and global state
   - HTMX event coordination
   - Common helper functions

5. **app.js** (18 lines)
   - Main application coordinator
   - Module initialization and orchestration

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **32% Code Reduction**: 858 → 584 lines with improved functionality
- ✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each module has single responsibility
- ✅ **Better Maintainability**: Easier debugging and feature additions
- ✅ **Eliminated Code Duplication**: Shared utilities in core module

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes Completed

#### 1. **Infinite "Loading preview..." Bug**

- **Issue**: "Apply to Cron" button showed infinite loading after first use, requiring page reload
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript function name collisions and stale modal container references due to HTMX repeatedly executing modal scripts
- **Fix**: Moved all modal logic from template to dedicated module with proper scoped initialization

#### 2. **Job Vanishing Issue**

- **Issue**: Multiple pending jobs would vanish after creation, only allowing one job at a time
- **Fix**: Improved form submission logic and zone refresh handling in modal manager

#### 3. **Broken Cancel Button**

- **Issue**: Modal cancel button stopped working after refactoring
- **Fix**: Updated event handler selectors in modal manager

#### 4. **Missing Detailed Changes**

- **Issue**: Cron review modal only showed generic summary instead of detailed changes
- **Fix**: Restored detailed change display with proper template literal syntax and helper functions

#### 5. **Schedule View Display Issues**

- **Issue**: Day selector had white-on-white active button (unreadable) and "no jobs" for all hours
- **Root Cause**:
  - Missing active/inactive state management for day buttons
  - Schedule view only showed 6 AM - 11 PM, but most jobs scheduled 12 AM - 6 AM
- **Fix**:
  - Proper button state management with blue/white contrast
  - Extended schedule view to full 24-hour range (00:00-23:59)
  - Added descriptive action text instead of just color coding

### 🎨 User Experience Improvements

#### Enhanced Schedule Visualization

- **24-Hour Coverage**: Now shows all hours 00:00-23:59 instead of limited 6 AM-11 PM window
- **Descriptive Action Text**: Clear labels like "Play Playlist", "Volume → 45%", "Resume Playback"
- **Color + Text**: Maintains color coding while adding readable action descriptions
- **Better Accessibility**: Users can understand job types without relying on color alone

#### Improved Modal Workflow

- **Instant Feedback**: All modal operations provide immediate visual confirmation
- **State Persistence**: Modal state properly maintained across operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery options
- **Consistent Behavior**: All modals behave predictably regardless of entry point

#### Professional Polish

## 2025-07-01 - Critical Volume Action Fix: Two-Type Volume Control Implementation

**Status**: Fixed non-functional volume action by implementing proper two-type volume control architecture

**Critical Issue Fixed**:

- ✅ **Volume Action Not Working**: Fixed volume actions having no effect due to wrong implementation
  - **Root Cause**: All volume actions incorrectly used `spotify volume X` (invalid command) instead of proper volume control mechanisms
  - **Original Design Intent**: Based on AppleScript examples (`regulate.scpt`, `connect.scpt`), the system was designed for **two distinct volume control types**:
    1. **Spotify Global Volume**: For "All Speakers" - controls Spotify's master playback volume
    2. **Airfoil Speaker Volume**: For individual/custom speakers - controls specific speaker volume in Airfoil
  - **Problem**: Current implementation only attempted Spotify volume control for all cases, using wrong command syntax

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Fixed Spotify Command Syntax** (`aircron_run.sh`):

   ```bash
   # OLD: "$SPOTIFY_CMD" volume "$1"  # Invalid command
   # NEW: "$SPOTIFY_CMD" vol "$1"     # Correct command
   ```

2. **Implemented Airfoil Speaker Volume Control**:

   ```bash
   # For individual speakers: Control Airfoil speaker volume
   AIRFOIL_VOLUME=$(echo "scale=2; $1 / 100" | bc -l)  # Convert % to 0.0-1.0
   osascript -e "tell application \"Airfoil\" to try
       set (volume of every speaker whose name is \"$SPEAKER\") to $AIRFOIL_VOLUME
   end try"
   ```

3. **Proper Volume Control Logic**:
   - **All Speakers**: Uses `spotify vol X` for global Spotify volume control (affects all output)
   - **Individual Speaker**: Uses Airfoil AppleScript to set specific speaker volume (affects only that speaker)
   - **Custom Speaker Groups**: Uses Airfoil AppleScript for each selected speaker individually

**Volume Control Behavior Now**:

- ✅ **"All Speakers" Volume**: Changes Spotify's global output volume (affects all connected speakers equally)
- ✅ **Individual Speaker Volume**: Changes that specific speaker's volume in Airfoil (allows different volume per speaker)
- ✅ **Custom Speaker Groups**: Changes volume for each selected speaker independently in Airfoil
- ✅ **Percentage Conversion**: UI percentages (0-100%) correctly convert to Airfoil decimal format (0.0-1.0)

**Verification Tests Passed**:

1. ✅ **All Speakers Volume**: `./aircron_run.sh "All Speakers" volume 55` → Spotify volume changed to 54
2. ✅ **Individual Speaker Volume**: `./aircron_run.sh "Computer" volume 50` → Airfoil speaker volume changed from 0.75 to 0.50
3. ✅ **Command Syntax**: Spotify volume commands now use correct `vol` instead of invalid `volume`
4. ✅ **Logging**: Proper distinction between "Spotify volume control" vs "Airfoil speaker volume" in logs
5. ✅ **Exit Codes**: All volume commands return exit code 0 (success)

**User Experience Impact**:

- **Volume actions now work**: Previously non-functional volume schedules will now execute properly
- **Proper Speaker Control**: Individual speakers can have different volume levels via Airfoil
- **Global Volume Control**: "All Speakers" provides unified volume control via Spotify
- **Professional Audio Setup**: Enables hotel/business audio management with per-zone volume control

**Original Design Fulfilled**: This fix implements the original volume control architecture as evidenced by the AppleScript examples (`prompts/bin/regulate.scpt`, `connect.scpt`) which show Airfoil speaker volume control was always the intended approach for individual speaker management.

## 2025-07-01 - Critical Delete & Apply Fixes: UI Refresh & Empty Job Handling

**Status**: Fixed major UX issues with job deletion and cron application

**Critical Issues Fixed**:

- ✅ **Delete Job UI Refresh Issue**: Fixed jobs not disappearing from UI after deletion until page refresh

  - **Root Cause**: DELETE API endpoint returned 204 No Content, but HTMX needed HTML to replace deleted element
  - **Problem**: Users would delete jobs and see them still listed until manually refreshing the page
  - **Solution**:
    - Modified `DELETE /api/jobs/<zone>/<job_id>` to return `<div style="display: none;"></div>` with 200 status
    - Updated HTMX target from `hx-target="closest div"` to `hx-target="closest .border"` for proper element selection
  - **Result**: Jobs now immediately disappear from UI when deleted, providing instant visual feedback

- ✅ **Apply to Cron Error After Deleting All Jobs**: Fixed 400 error when applying cron with no jobs
  - **Root Cause**: `apply_cron` endpoint treated 0 jobs as an error condition instead of valid "clear cron" operation
  - **Problem**: After deleting all jobs, clicking "Apply to Cron" would show error: "No jobs found to apply"
  - **Error**: `POST http://127.0.0.1:3009/api/cron/apply 400 (BAD REQUEST)`
  - **Solution**:
    - Removed the error condition for 0 jobs in `POST /api/cron/apply`
    - Allow `CronManager.apply_jobs_to_cron()` to run normally (properly clears cron section)
    - Return success response for both job application and cron clearing
  - **Result**: "Apply to Cron" now succeeds when clearing all jobs, properly maintaining empty cron section

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Delete API Fix** (`app/api.py`):

   ```python
   # OLD: return "", 204
   # NEW: return '<div style="display: none;"></div>', 200
   ```

2. **HTMX Target Fix** (`templates/partials/jobs_list.html`):

   ```html
   <!-- OLD: hx-target="closest div" -->
   <!-- NEW: hx-target="closest .border" -->
   ```

3. **Cron Apply Logic Fix** (`app/api.py`):
   ```python
   # OLD: if total_jobs == 0: return error
   # NEW: Always run apply_jobs_to_cron() - handles both apply and clear
   ```

**User Experience Improvements**:

- ✅ **Immediate Delete Feedback**: Jobs disappear instantly when deleted
- ✅ **No More Apply Errors**: "Apply to Cron" works correctly with zero jobs
- ✅ **Proper Cron Clearing**: Empty job store correctly clears cron section (shows only BEGIN/END markers)
- ✅ **Consistent Workflow**: Delete → Apply → Success (no error interruptions)
- ✅ **Error Elimination**: Fixed infinite loader hangs on failed apply operations

**Verification Tests Passed**:

1. ✅ **Delete UI Refresh**: Jobs immediately removed from UI when deleted via HTMX
2. ✅ **Empty Apply Success**: `POST /api/cron/apply` returns `{"ok": true}` with 0 jobs
3. ✅ **Cron Section Cleared**: Crontab correctly shows empty AirCron section after clearing all jobs
4. ✅ **API Response Format**: DELETE endpoint returns valid HTML for HTMX element replacement
5. ✅ **No More 400 Errors**: Apply operations succeed regardless of job count

**Workflow Now**:

- **Delete Jobs**: Select jobs → Delete → Jobs immediately disappear from UI
- **Clear All Jobs**: Delete all → Apply to Cron → Success (cron section cleared)
- **Mixed Operations**: Add/edit/delete jobs → Apply → All changes reflected correctly

**Result**: The delete and apply workflow is now seamless and error-free. Users get immediate visual feedback for all operations and can confidently manage their job schedules without encountering confusing error states or UI lag.

## 2025-07-01 - Modal Multi-Speaker Selection & UX Improvements

**Status**: Major UX improvement for schedule creation/editing

**New Features:**

- **Unified Add/Edit Modal**: Both add and edit schedule modals now feature a scrollable, multi-select speaker area at the top.
- **Flexible Speaker Selection**: Users can select any combination of speakers directly in the modal, not just from the sidebar.
- **"All Speakers" Logic**: Selecting "All Speakers" disables all other checkboxes. If all individual speakers are checked, "All Speakers" is auto-selected and the rest are disabled.
- **Consistent Backend**: The backend now always receives the correct zone string based on the modal selection, for both add and edit flows.
- **JS Logic**: New JavaScript ensures the UI is always in sync with the selection logic and disables/enables checkboxes as needed.

**User Experience:**

- Users can create or edit schedules for any combination of speakers in a single step.
- The modal is always consistent, regardless of entry point.

**Technical Notes:**

- The modal template and JS were refactored for both add and edit flows.
- No backend API changes required; only the modal and JS logic were updated.

## 2025-01-29 - UX/UI Bug Fixes & Cron Review System

**Status**: Fixed major UX issues and implemented cron review/preview system

**Major Issues Fixed**:

- ✅ **Cron Status Logic Bug**: Fixed incorrect "Pending" status for applied jobs

  - **Root Cause**: Status endpoint only checked if any jobs existed in cron vs total stored jobs
  - **Fix**: Complete rewrite of `/api/cron/status` to compare actual job content
  - **Technical**: Now compares sets of current vs expected cron lines to determine `jobs_match`
  - **Result**: Jobs correctly show "Applied" when they match cron, "Pending Apply" when they don't

- ✅ **Status Confusion After Job Creation**: Fixed jobs showing "Applied" immediately then "Pending" after clicking apply

  - **Root Cause**: Status logic was backwards - new jobs were incorrectly marked as applied
  - **Fix**: Updated `updateCronStatusUI()` to properly check `jobs_match && has_jobs_in_cron`
  - **Result**: New jobs correctly show "Pending Apply" until actually applied to cron

- ✅ **Missing Cron Review Modal**: Added confirmation dialog before applying changes

  - **Feature**: New `/api/cron/preview` endpoint that shows exactly what will change
  - **UI**: Modal shows jobs to add (green), remove (red), and keep (gray)
  - **Safety**: Users can see exactly what will happen before applying changes
  - **Files**: `templates/partials/cron_review_modal.html`, route at `/modal/cron/review`

- ✅ **Missing "View Current Cron Jobs" Feature**: Added button to view all active cron entries

  - **Feature**: New `/api/cron/current` endpoint returns formatted AirCron section
  - **UI**: Modal displays syntax-highlighted cron section with human-readable summaries
  - **Button**: New "📋 View Cron Jobs" button in header
  - **Files**: `templates/partials/cron_view_modal.html`, route at `/modal/cron/view`

- ✅ **Bottom Padding Issue**: Fixed Composite Speakers section touching viewport bottom
  - **Fix**: Added `pb-8` class to main container
  - **Result**: Proper spacing at bottom of page for better visual balance

**New API Endpoints**:

1. **Enhanced `/api/cron/status`**:

   - Returns detailed comparison between stored jobs and cron jobs
   - New fields: `jobs_match`, `current_cron_jobs`, `expected_cron_jobs`, etc.

2. **New `/api/cron/preview`**:

   - Shows preview of changes that will be made when applying to cron
   - Returns `will_add`, `will_remove`, `will_keep` arrays
   - Includes detailed job information for UI display

3. **New `/api/cron/current`**:
   - Returns current AirCron section from crontab
   - Formatted for display with syntax highlighting support

**UI Improvements**:

- **Header Buttons**:

  - Changed "Apply to Cron" to show review modal instead of direct application
  - Added "View Cron Jobs" button to inspect current cron state
  - Maintained "Refresh" button for speaker discovery

- **Modal System**:

  - Review modal with detailed change preview and confirmation
  - View modal with syntax-highlighted cron display
  - Proper error handling and loading states

- **Status Indicators**:
  - "Applied" = jobs match what's in cron
  - "Pending Apply" = jobs don't match cron (need to apply changes)
  - "No Jobs" = no jobs stored in application

**Technical Improvements**:

- **Cron Comparison Logic**: Now uses set comparison of actual cron command lines
- **Modal Architecture**: Added proper routes and template structure for modals
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and loading states in modals
- **Code Organization**: Separated cron preview logic from application logic

**User Workflow Now**:

1. **Create schedules** using existing interface
2. **See "Pending Apply" status** for new/changed jobs
3. **Click "Apply to Cron"** → Review modal opens
4. **Review changes** in detail (adds/removes/keeps)
5. **Confirm application** → Changes applied to cron
6. **See "Applied" status** once changes are in cron
7. **Click "View Cron Jobs"** to inspect current cron state anytime

**Verification Tests Passed**:

1. ✅ **Status Accuracy**: Applied jobs show "Applied", pending jobs show "Pending Apply"
2. ✅ **Review Modal**: Shows correct preview with proper color coding for changes
3. ✅ **View Modal**: Displays current cron jobs with syntax highlighting
4. ✅ **Bottom Padding**: Page has proper spacing at bottom
5. ✅ **Modal Navigation**: All modal open/close actions work smoothly
6. ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages when API calls fail

**Known Working Flows**:

✅ **Complete Job Lifecycle**:

- Create job → "Pending Apply" status
- Review changes via modal → See job in "will add" section
- Apply changes → "Applied" status
- Edit job → "Pending Apply" status (for the change)
- Apply again → "Applied" status
- Delete job → Gone from both UI and cron after apply

The application now provides complete transparency into cron state with proper confirmation dialogs, eliminating confusion about what changes will be made and when jobs are actually active in cron.

## 2025-01-29 - Critical Bug Fixes & Improvements

## 2025-01-29 - Critical UI Bug Fixes

**Status**: Fixed remaining critical issues with modal functionality and job display

**Major Issues Fixed**:

- ✅ **Modal Cancel Button Bug**: Fixed cancel button clearing schedules list

  - **Root Cause**: Cancel button had broken `hx-get=""` attribute that triggered empty HTMX request
  - **Fix**: Replaced with simple `onclick="closeModal()"` function
  - **Result**: Cancel now properly closes modal without affecting job list
  - Also fixed modal overlay click-to-close functionality

- ✅ **Jobs Not Showing on Main Page**: Fixed jobs displaying as "No schedules yet" on initial page load

## Untracked/Advanced Features & Inconsistencies (as of 2025-07-01)

**Volume Control Architecture (Critical Implementation Detail)**:

- The app implements **dual volume control systems** not clearly documented in the original spec:
  - **"All Speakers" volume**: Controls Spotify's master volume (`spotify vol X`) - affects global audio output
  - **Individual/Custom speaker volume**: Controls Airfoil per-speaker volume via AppleScript - allows independent speaker levels
- This two-type volume control enables professional audio management: global synchronization + zone-specific control
- The same "volume" action produces completely different behaviors depending on the target zone
- Multi-speaker custom groups apply volume to each speaker individually in sequence

**UI/UX Enhancements Beyond Original Spec**:

- The modal UI for add/edit is now a multi-select, not a static zone field as shown in the spec.
- The "All Speakers" logic (auto-disable/auto-select) is not described in the spec.
- The playlist picker in the modal is now fully integrated and required for play actions, with validation and fallback to manual URI entry.
- The tab-based navigation and playlist management system are more advanced than the original spec.
- The cron review modal now uses job cards, not raw cron lines, and groups jobs by status with color coding.
- The sidebar composite speaker logic and dynamic button for multi-speaker schedules are not described in the spec.

**Backend API & Storage Enhancements**:

- The JS logic for dynamic zone/selection tracking, error handling, and modal state is more robust than described in the docs.
- The API supports composite and custom zones, and the UI exposes this in a more user-friendly way than the spec describes.
- Job labels (display names) are now required for all jobs and shown throughout the UI - not mentioned in original spec.
- Real-time status indicators (Applied/Pending Apply) with dynamic cron comparison logic.
- Enhanced error handling, logging, and user feedback systems throughout.

**Professional Audio Management Features**:

- Per-speaker volume control via Airfoil enables zone-specific audio levels (hotel/business use case)
- Global volume control via Spotify enables synchronized audio adjustments across all zones
- Multi-speaker custom groups support complex audio routing scenarios
- Real-time speaker discovery and connection management via AppleScript integration

**Technical Architecture Notes**:

- Volume control uses `bc` (basic calculator) for percentage-to-decimal conversion for Airfoil
- AppleScript error handling with `try/end try` blocks for robust speaker volume control
- Comprehensive logging distinguishes between Spotify vs Airfoil volume operations
- The shell wrapper (`aircron_run.sh`) implements the core dual volume control logic

## 2025-06-30 - Status Indicator Fix: Create Schedules Page Shows Correct Applied/Pending Status

**Status**: Fixed incorrect job status display in Create Schedules page

**Critical Issue Fixed**:

- ✅ **Create Schedules Status Bug**: Fixed all jobs showing "Pending Apply" regardless of actual cron status
  - **Root Cause**: `templates/partials/jobs_list.html` had hardcoded "Pending Apply" status badge
  - **Problem**: Users couldn't distinguish between jobs that were applied to cron vs those that needed applying
  - **Solution**: Updated backend to include dynamic status information for each job
  - **Implementation**:
    - Modified `app/views.py` `zone_view()` and `index()` functions to check actual cron status
    - Added cron comparison logic to determine if each job is applied or pending
    - Updated `jobs_list.html` template to use dynamic status with color coding
    - Added auto-refresh functionality after applying changes via modal

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Backend Status Logic** (`app/views.py`):

   - Added `_normalize_cron_line()` helper function for consistent cron line comparison
   - Enhanced `zone_view()` function to read current crontab and compare with stored jobs
   - Added status field ('applied', 'pending', 'unknown') to each job dict before rendering
   - Applied same logic to `index()` function for initial page load

2. **Frontend Template Updates** (`templates/partials/jobs_list.html`):

   - Replaced hardcoded "Pending Apply" badge with conditional status display
   - Green "Applied" badge for jobs that match cron entries
   - Yellow "Pending Apply" badge for jobs not yet in cron
   - Gray "Unknown" badge for edge cases

3. **UI Refresh Logic** (`templates/partials/cron_review_modal.html`):
   - Added automatic zone refresh after successful cron apply
   - Global `currentZone` variable sync for proper refresh targeting
   - Status indicators update immediately after applying changes

**User Experience Improvements**:

- ✅ **Accurate Status Display**: Jobs now correctly show "Applied" (green) when in cron, "Pending Apply" (yellow) when not
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Status indicators refresh automatically after applying changes
- ✅ **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded badges make it immediately obvious which jobs need attention
- ✅ **Workflow Transparency**: Users can see exactly what needs to be applied before using the Apply modal

**Verification Tests Passed**:

1. ✅ **Applied Jobs Display**: Existing jobs in cron show green "Applied" status
2. ✅ **Pending Jobs Display**: New jobs show yellow "Pending Apply" status
3. ✅ **Status Updates**: After applying via modal, pending jobs update to "Applied" status
4. ✅ **Cross-Tab Consistency**: Status is consistent between Create Schedules and Active Cron Jobs tabs
5. ✅ **Auto-Refresh**: UI refreshes automatically after cron apply operations

**Result**: The Create Schedules page now provides accurate, real-time feedback about which jobs are active in cron vs which need to be applied, eliminating user confusion about schedule status.

## 2025-06-30 - Critical Bug Fixes: Multiple Jobs & Active Cron Jobs Display

**Status**: Fixed major functionality bugs that were causing job loss and incorrect UI display

**Critical Issues Fixed**:

- ✅ **Multiple Jobs Bug**: Fixed issue where only the first job was saved to cron when applying multiple jobs

  - **Root Cause**: `CronManager` was using a cached `JobsStore` instance that didn't reload fresh job data
  - **Fix**: Modified `_generate_cron_lines()` to always create a fresh `JobsStore` instance
  - **Result**: All jobs are now correctly read from disk and written to crontab
  - **Verification**: Added comprehensive logging showing job counts and processing details

- ✅ **Loader Hang Issue**: Fixed frontend loader spinning forever on apply errors

  - **Problem**: Frontend didn't handle HTTP error responses properly
  - **Fix**: Enhanced `applyChanges()` function with proper error handling for non-200 responses
  - **Result**: Users now see clear error messages instead of infinite loading

- ✅ **Active Cron Jobs Display Issues**: Fixed missing labels and incorrect action descriptions
  - **Problem 1**: Job labels were not displayed (showed generic time instead)
  - **Problem 2**: All jobs incorrectly showed "Playlist: Default" regardless of actual action
  - **Fix**: Updated JavaScript template code to display correct `job.label` and proper action descriptions
  - **Result**: Now shows proper labels like "Test Job 1" and correct actions like "Pause playback", "Set volume to 75%"

**Enhanced Error Handling**:

- Added detailed logging throughout job processing pipeline
- Backend validation prevents applying when no jobs exist
- Frontend shows meaningful error messages with fallback alerts
- All HTTP error responses properly handled

**Technical Details**:

- **Files Modified**: `app/cronblock.py`, `app/api.py`, `templates/partials/cron_review_modal.html`, `app/jobs_store.py`, `templates/index.html`
- **Key Fix**: Fresh `JobsStore` instances ensure latest job data is always loaded
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debug output for job counts, zone processing, and cron generation
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status checking and user-friendly error display

**Verification Complete**:

✅ Multiple jobs (4 total) successfully saved and applied to cron  
✅ All jobs display with correct labels: "Test Job 1", "Test Job 2", "Test Job 3", "Start day volume"  
✅ Correct action descriptions: "Pause playback", "Resume playback", "Set volume to 75%"  
✅ No more incorrect "Playlist: Default" text  
✅ Proper error handling prevents loader hangs  
✅ Enhanced logging provides full visibility into job processing

**User Experience Now**:

- Users can add multiple jobs without losing any
- Active Cron Jobs page shows meaningful labels and action descriptions
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Apply process provides real-time feedback and never hangs

This resolves the core functionality issues that were preventing reliable multi-job scheduling.

## 2025-06-30 - UI Compactness Improvement: 2-Line Job Entries on Large Screens

**Status**: Optimized job entry layout for better space efficiency on larger screens

**UI Enhancement**:

- ✅ **Compact Job Entry Layout**: Redesigned job cards to use maximum 2 lines instead of 3 on larger screens
  - **Target**: Both Create Schedules and Active Cron Jobs pages
  - **Problem**: Previous layout wasted vertical space with 3+ lines per job entry on large screens
  - **Solution**: Responsive design that combines information horizontally on larger screens
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Line 1**: Job label/title + time + status badge (Applied/Pending)
    - **Line 2**: Days + Action + Speakers (for custom zones) - all on one line with proper spacing
    - Responsive breakpoints: wraps to multiple lines on smaller screens, stays compact on `lg+` screens
    - Used Tailwind's `flex-wrap lg:flex-nowrap` for responsive behavior

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Templates Updated**:

   - `templates/partials/jobs_list.html` (Create Schedules page)
   - `templates/partials/all_cron_jobs.html` (Active Cron Jobs page)

2. **Layout Changes**:

   - Reduced padding from `p-4` to `p-3` for tighter spacing
   - Added `min-w-0` and `truncate` classes for proper text overflow handling
   - Used `flex-shrink-0` for elements that shouldn't compress
   - Combined Days, Action, and Speakers info into single responsive line
   - Maintained accessibility with proper contrast and spacing

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Large screens (lg+)**: Everything fits on 2 lines with horizontal layout
   - **Smaller screens**: Gracefully wraps with `flex-wrap` for readability
   - **Mobile-friendly**: All information remains accessible on smaller devices

**User Experience Benefits**:

- ✅ **Space Efficiency**: 33% reduction in vertical space usage (3 lines → 2 lines)
- ✅ **More Jobs Visible**: Users can see more schedules without scrolling
- ✅ **Better Information Density**: Related information grouped logically
- ✅ **Maintained Readability**: Clear separation between job details
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works well across all screen sizes
